--1. Write a query that allows you to inspect the schema of the naep table.

SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'naep';


--2. Write a query that returns the first 50 records of the naep table.
SELECT * FROM naep LIMIT 50;

 SELECT * 
 FROM naep 
 LIMIT 50;
 
 
--3. Write a query that returns summary statistics for avg_math_4_score by state. Make sure to sort the results alphabetically by state name.

  SELECT state, ROUND(SUM(avg_math_4_score),0) AS sum_by_state, 
      ROUND(AVG(avg_math_4_score),0) AS average_by_state, 
      COUNT(avg_math_4_score) AS count_by_state, 
      MAX(avg_math_4_score) AS max_by_state, 
      MIN(avg_math_4_score) AS min_by_state 
  FROM naep GROUP BY state ORDER BY state;



--4. Write a query that alters the previous query so that it returns only the summary statistics for avg_math_4_score by state with differences
  in max and min values that are greater than 30.
  
   SELECT state, ROUND(SUM(avg_math_4_score),0) AS sum_by_state,
        ROUND(AVG(avg_math_4_score),0) AS average_by_state, 
        COUNT(avg_math_4_score) AS count_by_state, 
        MAX(avg_math_4_score) AS max_by_state, 
        MIN(avg_math_4_score) AS min_by_state
   FROM naep
   GROUP BY state 
   HAVING MAX(avg_math_4_score) - MIN(avg_math_4_score) > 30 
   ORDER BY state;
   
  
--5. Write a query that returns a field called bottom_10_states. This field should list the states in the bottom 10 for avg_math_4_score in the year 2000.

    SELECT state AS bottom_10_states 
    FROM naep WHERE year = '2000'
    ORDER BY avg_math_4_score ASC 
    LIMIT 10;
    

--6. Write a query that calculates the average avg_math_4_score, rounded to the nearest two decimal places, over all states in the year 2000.
   
    SELECT ROUND(AVG(avg_math_4_score),0) 
    FROM naep 
    WHERE year = '2000';
    

--7. Write a query that returns a field called below_average_states_y2000. This field should list all states with an avg_math_4_score less than the average over 
  all states in the year 2000.
  
    WITH avg_table AS
       (SELECT AVG(avg_math_4_score) AS all_state_avg
      	FROM naep 
      	WHERE year = '2000')
	
    SELECT state, avg_math_4_score
    FROM naep, avg_table
    WHERE year = '2000' AND 
	      avg_math_4_score < all_state_avg
    ORDER BY avg_math_4_score;
  
  
--8. Write a query that returns a field called scores_missing_y2000 that lists any states with missing values in the avg_math_4_score column of the naep table for the year 2000.

    SELECT state 
    FROM naep 
    WHERE avg_math_4_score IS null 
        AND year = '2000';


--9. Write a query that returns, for the year 2000, the state, avg_math_4_score, and total_expenditure from the naep table, joined using the LEFT OUTER JOIN clause with 
  the finance table. Use id as the key and order the output by total_expenditure from greatest to least. Make sure to round avg_math_4_score to the nearest two decimal places, 
  and then filter out NULL values in avg_math_4_scores in order to see any correlation more clearly.
  
    SELECT naep.state, ROUND(avg_math_4_score,2) AS avg_math_4_score_r, total_expenditure 
    FROM naep 
    LEFT OUTER JOIN finance ON naep.id = finance.id 
    WHERE naep.year = '2000' 
        AND NOT avg_math_4_score IS null 
    ORDER BY total_expenditure DESC;
